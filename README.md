# Password-Generator
The PyPassword Generator is a Python-based program designed to generate random passwords. The primary goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective password generator that can generate both easy-to-crack and highly secure, hard-to-crack passwords. The password generation process involves selecting random letters, symbols, and numbers, which can then be shuffled to ensure the output is unpredictable.

Features
    Easy-to-Crack Password (Eazy Level):
    
    This option generates passwords with a predefined order (letters first, then symbols, and finally numbers).
    
    Ideal for use cases where strong security is not a critical concern, or for quick password generation.
   Hard-to-Crack Password (Hard Level):
   
    The password is generated by combining random letters, symbols, and numbers, then shuffling the order of characters to enhance security.
    This level ensures a high degree of randomness, making it difficult to guess or crack.
Functionality

    The user is prompted to input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in the password.
    The program uses the random.choice() function to select characters from predefined lists of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    After collecting all the characters, the random.shuffle() function is used to randomize the order of the characters.
    Finally, the program outputs the generated password.

Requirements

    Python 3.x or higher.
    No external libraries are required; the program uses built-in Python libraries like random.

How to Use
  Clone the repository.
  Run the password_generator.py script.
  Enter the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers when prompted.
  The generated password will be printed on the screen.
 
    Example Output
    For example, the user may input:
    
    4 letters
    2 symbols
    2 numbers
    The output could look like this: g^2jk8&P
